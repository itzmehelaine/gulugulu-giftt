(most of the times ahem ahem.) when i say "i'll be right back" and you start singing, i hear it. and i love it each time. when that one time you sang on call when i asked you to was so good like your voice just melts me each time. i would never understand how you say "i'm insecure" like how. your eyes are prettier than any flower i have seen. your smile is sweeter than any cake i know. and your voice is so much more mesmerizing than my favorite song. in fact my favorite song might be your voice at this point. and your hair. do i have to say something? it's so pretty (lowkey jealous). you are so pretty. like sooo sooo pretty. i don't know how to explain it but you are adorable af. you look good in everything every color you wear YOU make it pretty. i love listening to you talk, sing, laugh everything. i loveeee your laugh it makes me smile i swear. i hope you stay happy every day and every moment. and i hope you'll be loved and cared for all your life. you turning 18 by the way uncle. don't touch minors. UR SO COOOL UGHHH I WANNA SAY MORE BUT I'LL STOP HERE.`,
